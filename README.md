aaj hum log class gye toh teacher nhi aaya tha, then random baatein chal rhi thi tabhi randomly sprints ki baat aayi.
Toh everyone was sharing their experience and bta rhe the kon kitna tez bhagta hai, out of which most of them knew
ki I run fast. But ek banda tha usne bola ki agar mujhe koi hra de toh he'll do anything. Then aman ne bol diya bas
ki hai toh lambu ko hra ke dikha. Wo ladka serious ho gya and bola ki chal barbeque ki bet lagate hai and let's race.
Maine has ke mna kar diya, but usko pta nhi kya dikkat thi faltu bole jaa rha tha sabko.. Toh maine bola bhai jaa yahan se,
kapoor ne khade hoke usko jaane ko bola. Then usne kapoor ko dhakka diya and said ki bas ki naa ho toh bola mat karo. Ab he did this
in front of the whole class and mujhe kapoor ki baat ko leke gussa aa gya, I said chal bet ON and dekhte hai kya karta hai tu.
Then 200 meter ki race rakhi and 20 log dekhne aaye, maine socha jeetna hee padega. Then race chalu hua and he was ahead of me and last mei
mai kaafi close aa gya but tab tak end tha then maine socha jump lagata hu last me, somehow I crossed the rope jo lagayi thi but cross karte hee
I fell down and mera nose rub ho gya zameen pe gande se and skin peel of hua thoda

tab se laal hua pda hai

and it's hurting a lot
